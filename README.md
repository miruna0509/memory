# Memory Card Game

The program is a game of memory, but with a twist. The window displays 12 cards, each card having a pair with the same image on the back. In order to win the game, the player has to find all of the matching pairs. However, matching two cards is not enough to receive a point, as they  must first answer a question related to mathematics, or to computer science. If the player answers correctly, their score increases by one. If they get the answer wrong, their score remains unchanged.
